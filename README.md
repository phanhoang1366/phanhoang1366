### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm @phanhoang1366

<!--
**phanhoang1366/phanhoang1366** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
**About me:**
- My name is Phan Huy Hoang (hence the 'phan' and 'hoang' in the username.)
- Born on 10/05/2005 (the date, month and year are divisible by 5, I know)
- I am an introvert, so I'm not really talking much and hard to catch up with other's conversations

**Hobbies:**
- Iâ€™m working on a Discord bot using Python on a private server.
- Iâ€™m currently ~~learning C++ and Python~~ not anymore, I am braindead. I am currently learning English though.
- I'm still in high school, so there aren't many activities here and there.
- I play games a lot, like 30 minutes to 1 hour per day. My favorites are Genshin Impact, Half-Life 2, osu! and Muse Dash.

**Random stuff:**
- This account will have a fork of an Online Judge, so that a school from a friend of mine (Le Hong Phong High School) will use it.
